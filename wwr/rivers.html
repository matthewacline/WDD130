        <h2 class="salmonriver-title">Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h2>
        <p class="salmonriver-info"> Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return 
            winds the Salmon river. The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River 
            of No Return by the people living near it because of the number of folks that came 
            to visit and fell so in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left.</p>
        <p class="salmonriver-info">Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn 
            sheep are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring 
            ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter 
            from sun or rain when needed.</p>
        <p class="salmonriver-info">Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest 
            undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, 
            and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are 
            good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate 
            the late summer's slower, warmer water more.</p>

        <h2 class="desolationriver-title">Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h2>
        <p class="desolationriver-info"> Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate 
            land anywhere, the Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High 
            grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. 
            This 84-mile trip runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) 
            and boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric 
            and historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.</p> 
        <p class="desolationriver-info">Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days.</p>
        <p class="desolationriver-info">Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  This designation is based 
            on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.</p>

        <h2 class="grandriver-title">Grand Canyon, Arizona</h2>
        <p class="grandriver-info"> This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all 
            river trips. You will never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.</p>
        <p class="grandriver-info">Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery 
            to make one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with 
            exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins 
            accessible only by river.</p>
        <p class="grandriver-info">CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the 
            Canyon are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety 
            of rapids and river variances. However, most people are familiar with the regular 
            I - V river rating scale, so we often refer to both.</p>
