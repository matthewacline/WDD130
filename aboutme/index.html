    <h2>Matthew A Cline</h2>
    <h2>Matt for short</h2>
    <p>I am a third year student at BYU-Idaho and am pursuing a Bachelors degree in Applied Science. 
        I enjoy playing video games, playing board games, D&D, crocheting, painting minis, acting in local theatre, 
        and playing various musical instruments. I have a wife, Lexi, of 5 years and a brand new baby girl, Alanna. 
        We are both converts to the church for a few years. I currently work at USPS as a clerk, but hope to get a 
        job with NASIC someday soon. </p>
