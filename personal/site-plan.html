      <h3>A.K. Cline Fine Art</h3>
      <p>
        A.K. Cline was born in Grand Junction, Colorado and grew up in various places in Colorado and Utah. 
        This garnered a love for the mountains, forests, deserts, and she never lacked a place to explore. 
        At a young age, she would doodle and enjoy making up her own characters. As time went on, she developed 
        a talent for art and art history, although she was her own worst critic. An art teacher she once had, 
        liked to teach a lesson of detachment by going to students' works in progress and painting a big black 
        streak across the canvas. She recalls that when he came to her, he told her she ruins her own artwork. 
        Nearing her graduation from high school, she had a choice of paths, and instead of going off to the Navy, 
        she decided to go to college to pursue her art after being convinced by her father, her self-proclaimed 
        biggest fan. After spending a short time at Colorado Mesa University, she transferred to Wright State 
        University in Dayton, Ohio where she majored in Art and Sculpture, with a minor in art history. She 
        raduated with her Bachelors Degree in 2020. She’s married to her husband Matthew, and has a daughter, Alanna.

      <h3>Matthew's Works</h3>
      <p>
        Matthew Cline is husband to the renowned artist A.K. Cline. He grew up in Arcanum, Ohio and graduated 
        from the local high school in 2010. Since then he has explored a couple different collegiate paths until 
        settling on Applied Tech in the IT industry at BYU-Idaho. He has been dabbling in a number of different 
        hobbies for most of his adult life. He has been deeply engaged with woodworking for the past couple of years, 
        gaining enough knowledge to build his mother-in-law a bed frame, along with some smaller projects. He is 
        beginning to learn about leatherworking and blacksmithing. He one day hopes to learn from his wife’s uncle, 
        Jeremy Hodges, who is a manager of a leather working shop in Colorado. Matthew also plans to have an extensive 
        garden with his wife at their new property, where they can grow fresh fruits and vegetables to feed their family, 
        sell the excess, and distill many of the flowers, herbs, and other products into essential oils. Matthew also 
        has crochet experience and has most recently made a baby blanket for his daughter! Lastly, he plans to frame 
        each one of his wife’s paintings with custom frames, made right in the home shop. A.K. Cline worked as a 
        professional custom framer for nearly a decade and has done museum-quality work countless times. With their 
        knowledge combined, these two are an unstoppable creative force!

      <h3>Jenniflower's Creations</h3>
      <p>
        Jenniflower is the mother of A.K. Cline and an enthusiastic lover of all things nature. Early in her adult 
        life, she was the head of a small landscaping company in Colorado. Later, she showed her talent for flower 
        arranging, working as a freelancer and donating much of her time and effort to memorial ceremonies in the 
        Salt Lake area of Utah. She’s always had a creative mind, making small trinkets and jewelry from found materials 
        in her spare time. Her proudest creations are her stained glass panels, whether in the form of windows, wall 
        hangings, or garden sculptures.
