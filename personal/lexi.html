            <h1>A. K. Cline</h1>
            <p>A.K. Cline was born in Grand Junction, Colorado and grew up in various places in Colorado and Utah. 
                This garnered a love for the mountains, forests, deserts, and she never lacked a place to explore. 
                At a young age, she would doodle and enjoy making up her own characters. As time went on, she developed 
                a talent for art and art history, although she was her own worst critic. An art teacher she once had, 
                liked to teach a lesson of detachment by going to students' works in progress and painting a big black 
                streak across the canvas. She recalls that when he came to her, he told her she ruins her own artwork. 
                Nearing her graduation from high school, she had a choice of paths, and instead of going off to the Navy, 
                she decided to go to college to pursue her art after being convinced by her father, her self-proclaimed 
                biggest fan. After spending a short time at Colorado Mesa University, she transferred to Wright State 
                University in Dayton, Ohio where she majored in Art and Sculpture, with a minor in art history. She 
                raduated with her Bachelors Degree in 2020. Sheâ€™s married to her husband Matthew, and has a daughter, Alanna.</p>
