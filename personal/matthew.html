            <h1>Matthew Cline</h1>
            <p>Matthew Cline is husband to the renowned artist A.K. Cline. He grew up in Arcanum, Ohio and graduated 
                from the local high school in 2010. Since then he has explored a couple different collegiate paths until 
                settling on Applied Tech in the IT industry at BYU-Idaho. He has been dabbling in a number of different 
                hobbies for most of his adult life. He has been deeply engaged with woodworking for the past couple of years, 
                gaining enough knowledge to build his mother-in-law a bed frame, along with some smaller projects. He is 
                beginning to learn about leatherworking and blacksmithing. He one day hopes to learn from his wife’s uncle, 
                Jeremy Hodges, who is a manager of a leather working shop in Colorado. Matthew also plans to have an extensive 
                garden with his wife at their new property, where they can grow fresh fruits and vegetables to feed their family, 
                sell the excess, and distill many of the flowers, herbs, and other products into essential oils. Matthew also 
                has crochet experience and has most recently made a baby blanket for his daughter! Lastly, he plans to frame 
                each one of his wife’s paintings with custom frames, made right in the home shop. A.K. Cline worked as a 
                professional custom framer for nearly a decade and has done museum-quality work countless times. With their 
                knowledge combined, these two are an unstoppable creative force!</p>
